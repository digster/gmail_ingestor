## Fix: `.env` output directory settings not respected

### Problem
`GmailIngestorSettings` uses `env_prefix="GMAIL_"` (pydantic-settings), which means all fields expect env vars prefixed with `GMAIL_`. However, `.env` defined `OUTPUT_MARKDOWN_DIR`, `OUTPUT_RAW_DIR`, `DATABASE_PATH`, and `LOG_LEVEL` without the prefix — so they were silently ignored and defaults were used instead.

### Changes
- **`.env`** — Renamed `OUTPUT_MARKDOWN_DIR` → `GMAIL_OUTPUT_MARKDOWN_DIR`, `OUTPUT_RAW_DIR` → `GMAIL_OUTPUT_RAW_DIR`, `DATABASE_PATH` → `GMAIL_DATABASE_PATH`, `LOG_LEVEL` → `GMAIL_LOG_LEVEL`
- **`.env.example`** — Applied the same renames for consistency
- **`README.md`** — Added the four missing env vars to the configuration table

### Verification
- Settings now correctly load values from `.env` (confirmed `output_markdown_dir` = `../../output/markdown` instead of default `output/markdown`)
- All 225 tests pass

## Created: SKILL.md

### Purpose
Added a `SKILL.md` quick-reference file at the project root — a scannable cheat sheet covering one-liner description, prerequisites, setup, CLI reference, Python API, pipeline architecture, output format, configuration env vars, testing commands, and common recipes.

### Details
- All CLI commands and flags verified against `scripts/cli.py`
- All env vars verified against `src/gmail_ingestor/config/settings.py`
- Public API exports verified against `src/gmail_ingestor/__init__.py`
